A CS lesson for learning C programming
This code is meant to demonstrate how to work with files, chars and pointers
The idea is for the student to take this code as a starting point and enhance it

The program currently reads a file from disk and displays the number of bytes
that were read. Here are some steps to take this functionality further:

1) Count the number of words in the file
2) Convert all of the letters to capitals
3) Reverse the letters in each word (e.g. "Hello World!" becomes "olleH !dlroW"
4) Count the frequency of occurance of each letter

To compile and run the program type at the command line:

make
./cs2 <infile>

<infile> should be replaced with the pathname to a text file
